      "aboutMeParagraph": "Welcome to my website! I’m Sophie Stupalo, a 2024 biomedical engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo. My passion lies at the intersection of medicine and innovation, with the ultimate goal of becoming a physician and contributing to the development of novel medical devices or administrative tools that improve patient outcomes and reduce physician burnout. I am deeply committed to advocating for equitable access to care and enhancing Canada's universal healthcare system, all while safeguarding it from the threat of privatization.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about my journey, keep reading.\n\nThroughout my life, I've often started from behind but have always worked my way to the top through dedication and perseverance. Take my hockey journey, for instance. When I switched from boys’ recreational hockey to girls’ competitive hockey, my parents encouraged me to tryout for every level, from AA to B. I secured one of the last spots on the B team, but I made the most of every opportunity—multiple practices a week, extra power skating sessions—and by the end of the season, I was one of the best players. This pattern of growth and relentless improvement repeated every year until I earned a spot on the AA team in my final year of high school.\n\nEven after leaving competitive hockey, I continued applying my goal-driven work ethic to other areas, particularly my university studies. Coming from a basic public high school, I initially felt behind classmates who had more advanced academic backgrounds from IB, AP, or private schools. Yet, through hard work and determination, I became the top student in my class in my 4A term.\n\nA significant part of my university experience was about seeking out opportunities for growth and self-discovery. My aspirations were shaped by my final co-op term at Trudell Medical International (more details on my Experience page), founding the University of Waterloo Lacrosse Club, and working on my fourth-year design project (see the Projects page).\n\nIf you're looking for someone who may not know all the answers right away but has the curiosity, resourcefulness, and drive to figure things out and achieve meaningful results, you've come to the right place.

          "content": "My decision to study at the University of Waterloo (UW) was a difficult one as it meant I would have to give up playing the sport of lacrosse. Instead of giving up the sport I loved, I founded a women’s lacrosse club at my school with the goal of one day developing into a competitive OUA varsity team. This project began in the fall of 2019 and has since developed into a co-ed club.\n\nDuring the summer prior to attending my first year I got started on this endeavor, collecting donated equipment, reaching out to UW athletics, advertising though the Ontario Lacrosse Association and navigating the club establishment process. In the fall I attended the Warriors Athletic Club fair to showcase our club and advertise our try-it sessions which proved to be a huge success.  By the end of our first term our club had 20 registered participants.  The restrictions due to the COVID pandemic made it more difficult for people to join our practices but participants’ continued engagement and interest have kept the club alive.\n\nNot every sports team I have participated on in the past has been as welcoming as it should have been so when creating my club’s constitution, I made sure to focus on developing policies to foster a positive and friendly environment.  I also decided to continue running a club team even after a varsity team has been established so that other students who join the club can enjoy the same benefits in a less competitive and demanding environment. Our club is also working with the UW Alliance, and the Black Liberated Athletes Coalition to ensure we are taking all steps necessary to truly embrace diversity and welcome everyone who may be interested in playing lacrosse. Since our club was built on the values of equity and inclusiveness, we work hard to balance our membership fees so that it is not a limiting factor for who can play in our club while also maximizing our revenue so that we can provide a stick for any player that does not already have one.\n\nNow I currently hold the position of President of the UW Field Lacrosse club team. In this role, I am responsible for chairing weekly executive meetings to plan future club initiatives as well as creating and executing 2 practice plans each week. One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced has been acquiring borrowed or cheap equipment since lacrosse is not a common sport. What I have learned is that good things come to those who seek them, and it was a matter of reaching out the right people to solve my problem. Not being afraid to ask for favors from the community has provided our club with over 60 sticks, 3 nets, and lots of lacrosse balls.\n\nThe success of the club so far has been extremely rewarding and I am excited at the prospect of reaching our club’s goal of becoming a competitive team prior to my graduation in 2024.",

          "content": "Over 10 years ago, my dad purchased the stupalo.com domain with the hopes that one day either my brother or I would need it. Finally, during my previous summer co-op term in 2022 I had the time to design and develop this personal portfolio website. I first attempted this task in 2020 using Webflow, however, I was not happy with the initial design that I created, and I felt that I was missing out on the opportunity to learn how to develop a website from scratch. Revisiting this project in 2022, I decided to take a different approach. Instead, I broke this project down into 4 main stages: (1) designing the screens and their relationships, (2) implementing each screen using ReactJS, (3) creating written and visual content for each section, and (4) deploying the completed website.\n\nI first taught myself the basics of Figma using the documentation and YouTube. I browsed the internet for inspiration and created a simple black and white wireframe of each screen first. Once I was happy with the layout of information, I then added colour, icons, and fonts to make the design more cohesive and visually pleasing. I asked a few of my friends and family for feedback on my designs before proceeding to the next step.\n\nFollowing the completion of the screen designs and their relationships, I began teaching myself about ReactJS. I completed a tutorial provided by Codecademy to get a basic understanding of the framework. I then watched hours of YouTube tutorials before writing a single line of code to get a feel for how other developers organized their files systems, what tools they frequently used, and what advise they would give to beginner developers. Knowing the benefits of version control I decided to create a new GitHub repository to develop my website in. I then followed the React docs to create a template react app. I decided to use styled-components instead of the traditional className styling approach since styled components can be more easily reused across an entire project. I noticed the first step to every website was creating navbar. For this, I followed a YouTube tutorial step by step and then played around with the template code to replicate my custom styles and functionality. Since my website is a single page application, I decided to use React Router to handle routes. After creating the navbar component I had a clear understanding of React and easily created the home page, experience page, projects page, and footer components.\n\nAfter the bones of the website were established, it was time to create all of the content that would be filling in the lorem ipsum filler text and images I had put while in the development stage. I tracked down all the photos that I could find that would best represent the projects I wanted to showcase. I also created writeups for my “About” section, each of my work experiences, and each project. All of this content including paths to images are all stored within a single JSON file so that if I wanted to add new content or change the existing content, it could all be done from one place without modifying any code.\n\nAt this point, I was extremely proud of my website, and I was ready to show it off to whoever was lucky enough to land on stupalo.com. The last step I had to do was deploy my website. I am the biggest fan of doing things for free whenever possible which lead me to using GitHub Pages to deploy my website. After following the GitHub Pages docs and receiving excellent customer support from BareMetal, my website was finally live at stupalo.com!",

          "content": "In my 3A term (winter 2022) I took BME 588 – Special Topics in Biomechanics with a focus on Computational Biomechanics. Part of this course involved completing a biomechanical research project of choice. Since my partner and I had an interest in powerlifting and had often heard the claim that the rewards of deadlifts (one of the “big 3” lifts) were not worth the risks involved in the movement, we wanted to focus our research on proving whether or not this claim was true. Since our course had a significant focus on the OpenSim software, the objective of our study was to generate and validate two deadlifting motions (proper and improper form) in OpenSim with the purpose of contributing to combating this potential spread of misinformation in the powerlifting community.\n\nThe first step of this process involved collecting motion capture (MOCAP) data. Due to the multi-dimensional nature of human movement, this was accomplished using two different MOCAP techniques at once. The MOCAP setup involved two laptop cameras: one camera filming the anterior (front) view and one filming the right lateral (side) view of the deadlift subject. One of the two MOCAP techniques used was the MediaPipe Pose machine learning algorithm, which uses markerless pose tracking and background segmentation masking to infer the 3D location of 33 body landmarks. Note that none of these 33 landmarks were located along the spinal cord, therefore a second MOCAP technique was necessary to analyze spine curvature. The second MOCAP technique used a custom colour isolating algorithm which filtered by hue and saturation to isolate for the bright green markers which were glued onto our subject’s back. Before each deadlift recording was taken, the lights were flickered in order to sync the timing of each camera’s footage. We combined these datasets into the coordinate frame used by OpenSim by performing matrix transformations.\n\nOnce the MOCAP was finished we needed to translate our data from tables to a motion in OpenSim. This involved downloading the open source Full-Body Lifting model from SimTK, scaling the model based on our subject’s parameters, and placing markers on the model that coincided with each marker used during the data collection process. Once the markers were placed, we imported the MOCAP data as a motion file and ran an inverse kinematics simulation to visualise the motion of each subject. These models were then validated, and it was concluded that both motions were successfully created but with a degree of accuracy unsuitable for use in further research.\n\nI did not go into detail about it here, but we failed more times than we succeeded during this project and every small step forward became something to celebrate. Although this project was not successful, more than anything it taught me how to be resilient and how to work with any situation as grim as it may seem in the moment. Now it is easy to reflect and be extremely proud of what was accomplished during this project since we learned every technique and tool that we used in the moment while balancing the workload of 5 other courses.",

          "content": "In my 3A term (winter 2022) I took BME 355 – Physiological Systems Modelling. The term project for this course involved developing a model to determine optimal parameters (amplitude and frequency) for functional electrical stimulation (FES). Currently, FES is one of the most effective treatments of footdrop; an issue that occurs when an individual’s tibialis anterior (shin) muscle does not work properly, and they can no longer lift their toes while they walk. As described by its name, an FES device periodically stimulates the patient’s tibialis anterior muscle using small controlled electrical signals. Although this is the preferred treatment by patients, one of its main drawbacks is that it overstimulates the targeted muscles and quickly fatigues the muscle. The parameters of focus for this project were signal frequency and amplitude. The goal of this project was to determine the optimal parameters for FES. Optimal parameters would successfully reduce muscle fatigue caused by FES while lifting the foot sufficiently off the ground to prevent foot drop.\n\nWe achieved our goal by creating a simplified model of the leg, shank, and foot which was fixed at the hip but free to rotate at the knee and ankle joints. Using that model and first principles, we then created state-space equations to describe our system. With MATLAB, these equations allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between the height of the foot off the ground and the frequency or amplitude of the input signal. An exhaustive search determined that the optimal frequency and amplitude to be 50Hz and 2.177V, respectively. We then ran a final simulation to verify that these values for amplitude and frequency produced realistic foot and ankle behaviour and ensured that both the front and back of the foot cleared the ground, preventing foot drop.\n\nMy main contributions to this project involved generating the models for our simulations, managing our team, creating our final presentation, and performing the optimization of the FES parameters of interest. Throughout the whole project I acted as the project manager and facilitated communication across our various sub teams. My efforts to thoroughly understand our model and simulations allowed me to keep my other group members informed. I also challenged our approach to ensure we were not making any irrational assumptions. My contributions kept the team on track and allowed us to successfully determine optimal FES parameters through modelling and simulation.",

Inspired by many of my boyfriend’s woodworking projects, I decided to collaborate with him to create a waterfall coffee table. We had previously seen this type of table in a jewelry shop and thought this project would be a great use for our leftover live edge walnut board while expanding our woodworking skills.\n\nWe began designing our table by sketching it on paper, carefully planning the proportions to ensure the use of 18-inch hairpin legs—which determine the table’s height—would leave sufficient material for the tabletop to be at least three feet long after cutting a portion of the board for the “waterfall” leg. After we were happy with the design, we measured 18 inches from one end of the plank and made a precise 45-degree cut using a miter saw. This type of angled cut was repeated on the remaining plank to form a miter joint, allowing the wood grain to flow seamlessly from the tabletop into the leg.\n\nOnce both planks were cut, we used walnut wood filler to fix any gouges and cracks in the wood. We then sanded each piece with 50, 100, 150, and 200 grit sandpaper to remove surface imperfections and make them smooth to the touch. Our next step involved gluing the two pieces together with wood glue. Although we had corner clamps, we decided not to use them since they would likely rip of the bark from the edges of the boards. Instead, we created a rig out of spare wood that allowed us to clamp the boards together at a 90-degree angle without damaging the bark.\n\nOnce the glue had dried, we sanded the joined pieces again to remove any glue residue. We used tack cloths and pressurized air to clear away all dust in preparation for applying the finish. We applied multiple coats of a polyurethane water-based wood finish to both the surfaces and bark, enhancing the natural beauty of the walnut and providing lasting protection.\n\nOnce the final coat of finish was dry, we attached 18-inch hairpin legs and secured them with two L-brackets on the underside of the table for added stability. The finished table was not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly functional for our apartment. This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience and introduced me to several new woodworking techniques.",

          "content": "When my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, our family faced a challenging and emotional journey. I wanted to create something special to comfort her during her many medical appointments and recovery periods. That’s how the idea for this blanket was born.\n\nTo start, I found a beautiful granny square design on Pinterest that I thought my mom would love. With this design in mind, I selected four yarn colours that she would appreciate, combining them to create a cheerful yet calming palette. Since this was my first large-scale crochet project, I was unsure if I could commit to finishing it. To ease my fears of wasting money, I opted for affordable acrylic yarn, each skein costing around $5.\n\nThe granny square pattern I chose featured three key components: a flower center, flower petals, and a flower border, all made with the coloured yarn. These elements were divided by white yarn sections, allowing me to create six distinct flower colour patterns. Once I completed a few squares, I laid them out on a standard throw blanket to determine the final size. I decided the blanket would be 10 squares wide by 12 squares long, requiring a total of 120 squares. This meant that I had to create 20 squares for each of the six colour variations.\n\nOver the course of several months, I worked on the squares whenever I could find time. Once all 120 squares were complete, I faced the daunting task of sewing in the loose ends—arguably the least enjoyable part of any crochet project! Looking back, I would handle this differently by weaving in ends as I go rather than saving them all for the end.\n\nWith the squares finished and tidied up, I arranged them in a repeating pattern and pinned them together. Using brown yarn, I joined the squares added a frilly border around the edges, giving it a polished and decorative touch.\n\nAfter approximately six months of on-and-off effort, the blanket was complete and has since resided on my mom’s chair in her living room.\n\nThis project taught me so much. Completing a long-term crochet endeavor gave me the confidence to take on more ambitious projects in the future. Today, I work exclusively with natural fibers despite the cost since I know I will put them to good use and they will result in a nicer finished product. Most importantly, I’m happy to share that my mom is now cancer-free, a relief and joy for our whole family.",

          "content": "During my 2B term in summer 2022, I took a course called Prototyping, Simulation and Design (BME 261). In this course my peers and I were tasked with designing and creating a prototype solution for peripheral neuropathy patients. In short, peripheral neuropathy is a neurodegenerative disease that causes patients to experience tingling, pain, or even loss of sensation in their hands or feet, significantly increasing their risk of falls. The focus of my group’s project was to create a wearable device to help prevent falls by providing haptic feedback based on foot pressure.\n\nWe designed a smart sock that recorded pressure at the foot and relayed the information through vibrations at the knee or a higher point, depending on the patient’s needs. To tackle this project efficiently, we divided our team into two subgroups: technical report writing and prototyping. As the lead of the prototyping team, I was responsible for designing circuits, conducting verification testing, programming the Arduino Uno, 3D modeling and printing a protective case, and assembling the final prototype.\n\nThe heart of our system was an Arduino Uno, and we used Fritzing to design the circuits on a breadboard. Before we could assemble our circuits, we needed to determine the optimal secondary resistor to use in a voltage divider with the resistance sensors embedded in the insole. To do this, we built a test circuit with an interchangeable secondary resistor, allowing us to measure the output voltage read by the Arduino Uno. During testing, a subject walked over the insole, and we recorded data for each resistor value at multiple foot landmarks over three trials. This data allowed us to select the resistor that provided the largest sensing range for pressure variations at critical points.\n\nTo ensure the device was wearable and robust, I 3D-modeled a protective case in OnShape which securely housed the Arduino Uno and a 9V battery. After 3D printing the case, we soldered all components together and integrated them into the sock prototype.\n\nThis project was not only a rewarding design challenge but also a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience managing a project from concept to completion. It enhanced my circuit design, 3D modeling, prototyping, and collaboration skills while addressing a real-world problem.",

          "content": "In my Grade 12 physics class, our final project was to design and build a trebuchet that maximized launch distance and accuracy while minimizing weight. To prepare, I researched various trebuchet styles by exploring informational websites, hobbyist blogs, and YouTube videos. One video on optimizing trebuchet design introduced me to the whipper trebuchet, a compact and efficient style. Inspired by the creator’s use of CNC machining, I decided to construct my project from a single sheet of plywood, straying away from the traditional 2x4 construction typically seen in my class.\n\nThe whipper trebuchet's forward-focused design allowed me to concentrate the weight on the side panels, using minimal material for lateral stabilization. I began by sketching designs on paper and used physics principles to predict the velocity of the release hook based on different arm lengths and weight placements. Once I determined the optimal configuration, I transitioned to OnShape for detailed digital designs, modeling both the structural wood components and custom 3D-printed parts.\n\nKey 3D-printed components included a custom trigger and launch hook. The trigger featured attachment points for both the loading string and the launch string, which allowed me to launch the trebuchet from a safe distance. The launch hook was designed to slide over the arm and be secured with screws; it provided a fixed attachment point for one side of the sling and a hook for releasing the other side during launch.\n\nUsing OnShape, I optimized the layout of the wooden components to fit a single 4’x8’x¾’’ sheet of plywood. Additional hardware—such as brackets, bearings, hairpin clips, and axles - was procured from a hardware store.\n\nI built the trebuchet in my basement using my parents’ tools and conducted test launches at a vacant soccer field. Through experimentation with weights and hook angles, I tuned the device to achieve maximum distance and accuracy. During the live demonstration at school, these optimizations paid off, earning me a great mark for the project.\n\nAfterward, my teacher requested that I donate the trebuchet to the school as an example for future students, which I was honored to do.",

          "content": "At my parents’ house, it often feels like the home improvement projects are endless. When I was 13, we decided it was finally time to transform our 25-year-old deck from a splintered eyesore, into a stunning composite feature that would truly enhance our home. My parents led the project, with support from my brother and I, since we were eager to contribute and learn from the experience. We collaborated to design a warm and inviting backyard deck featuring plenty of seating that would be perfect for both large family gatherings and intimate get-togethers. Our design featured a spacious dining area on one side, a Muskoka-inspired fireplace on the other, and an open space in the middle for additional creative use. We used AutoCAD to bring our ideas to life, ensuring the design was both accurate and achievable.\n\nConstruction began with the demolition of the old deck. We quickly got to work regrading the deck site to ensure proper drainage. To support the new deck’s weight, we had ten-inch concrete piles professionally installed according to our drawings. We then installed the pressure treated frame using 2x12 beams and 2x10 joists at 12” centres. This heavy-duty construction was necessary because composite decking, while beautiful, is not as strong as wood and requires substantial support.\n\nOnce the frame was in place, we meticulously aligned the boards using a laser to ensure precision along the house. Each board was carefully cut with our custom-modified 'finger-safe' powered mitre saw. The frame was assembled with an array of framing brackets, nails, and screws, all designed for a low-profile finish. To keep the look clean, we cantilevered the frame to hide the concrete piles, creating a seamless edge around the deck. The four bench seats were then further cantilevered beyond the deck’s edge, adding a striking visual dimension.\n\nThe frame was then clad with composite deck boards in a diagonal herringbone pattern. All of the deck boards and the fascia boards were fastened using hidden hardware, resulting in a smooth surface with no visible screws.\n\nThe end result is a stunning deck that has earned endless compliments from our guests, filling me with a great sense of pride. I am grateful to have worked alongside my family on this two-year project and am happy to report that the project was injury-free!",
