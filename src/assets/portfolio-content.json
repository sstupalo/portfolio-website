          "content": "GoFleet and Zenduit are telematic solutions providers focused on optimizing fleet management which service a variety of industries. As a product manager I was in charge of numerous projects over the course of my 4-month coop term. Namely, I was responsible for the complete ownership two software products, ZenduTimeCard and Support Ticket add-in, I designed and managed the implementation of a self-serve model for our ZenduWork software, I developed user journeys for a new marketplace application, and I worked one-on-one with designers and developers to create and deploy multiple new websites and landing pages.\n\nZenduTimeCard is a time-tracking software that harnesses location tracking to automatically log employees’ hours and can be easily integrated with existing company payroll systems to make payroll more efficient and less error prone for HR administrators. Support Ticket add-in provides a comprehensive dashboard where administrators can submit and monitor the status of their company’s service requests. “Complete ownership” of each product meant that I was responsible for identifying and logging bugs, working with users to determine pain points, designing new features to tackle those pain points, writing structured development tickets, managing the priority of tickets, and finally, creating written and video documentation to describe how to use the tool and its new features.\n\nDesigning the ZenduWork self-serve model involved creating a thorough user journey that described the steps a user would take to create an account, learn the main features of the tool, and begin using the tool to manage their fleet’s work orders. Next, I worked with a designer to create cohesive and intuitive screens for each step of the process, transcribed welcome emails and steps for the onboarding tutorial, and monitored the initial development of this project.\n\nMy main learning outcomes from this position were how to create effective user journeys, how to manage myself and projects using modular ToDo lists, and how to communicate the progress of different projects with stakeholders."

As an agile software developer, I contributed to both the Mystique and Mystique Design Web (MDW) products while participating in regular agile sprint related meetings.\n\nThe Mystique software is an automated camera-based alignment and recalibration solution that streamlines the installation, alignment, calibration, and maintenance processes of multi-projection systems.\n\nMDW is a web application that allows users to simulate multi-projection setups and test the efficacy of the Mystique software prior to the final installation. My main term project involved developing the ability to simulate colour divergence and chromatic aberration within MDW. This full stack development used ReactJS to add UI inputs which allowed a user to select the translation, rotation, or scale of the red, green, or blue pixels of each projector. C++, CUDA, and OpenGL shaders were used to define the backend logic of each transformation and display where the transformed pixels would land on the screen.\n\nIn addition to my term project, I regularly completed bug fixes as they arose or were assigned to me."
