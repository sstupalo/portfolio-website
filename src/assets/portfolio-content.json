      "aboutMeParagraph": "Sophie Stupalo is a 3rd year biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo. She exhibits acute awareness of the existing and growing inequities deeply rooted in our current social constructs.  Sophie believes that these inequities must be addressed actively by developing and sharing technology that both meets the needs of today’s diverse and evolving society while sustainably addressing climate challenges.  She simply believes that inaction is socially inexcusable and morally unforgivable.\n\nChange is coming, and Sophie is confident in her ability to lead the way.  She feels responsible and inspired to add value and social good through her work.  She spreads enthusiasm amongst her friends and colleagues that share common values, and warmly connects with individuals that differ.\n\nSophie is caring, productive, decisive, and a delightful team leader and contributor.  With almost a decade of work experience, Sophie has proven herself as a leader who exhibits focus, determination and sheer will to drive initiatives from start to finish.\n\nSophie is looking forward to developing biotechnology that is socially equitable and considerate of our shared environment.  Her interests are in design, medicine, and entrepreneurship.  She is ready, with a sustainable approach and her attention to detail, to tackle the evolving challenges of global resource scarcity, climate change and sustainability.\n\nWelcome, keep exploring, maybe you'll find something inspiring and if you have any questions please reach out.",

          "content": "GoFleet and Zenduit are telematic solutions providers focused on optimizing fleet management which service a variety of industries. As a product manager I was in charge of numerous projects over the course of my 4-month coop term. Namely, I was responsible for the complete ownership two software products, ZenduTimeCard and Support Ticket add-in, I designed and managed the implementation of a self-serve model for our ZenduWork software, I developed user journeys for a new marketplace application, and I worked one-on-one with designers and developers to create and deploy multiple new websites and landing pages.\n\nZenduTimeCard is a time-tracking software that harnesses location tracking to automatically log employees’ hours and can be easily integrated with existing company payroll systems to make payroll more efficient and less error prone for HR administrators. Support Ticket add-in provides a comprehensive dashboard where administrators can submit and monitor the status of their company’s service requests. “Complete ownership” of each product meant that I was responsible for identifying and logging bugs, working with users to determine pain points, designing new features to tackle those pain points, writing structured development tickets, managing the priority of tickets, and finally, creating written and video documentation to describe how to use the tool and its new features.\n\nDesigning the ZenduWork self-serve model involved creating a thorough user journey that described the steps a user would take to create an account, learn the main features of the tool, and begin using the tool to manage their fleet’s work orders. Next, I worked with a designer to create cohesive and intuitive screens for each step of the process, transcribed welcome emails and steps for the onboarding tutorial, and monitored the initial development of this project.\n\nMy main learning outcomes from this position were how to create effective user journeys, how to manage myself and projects using modular ToDo lists, and how to communicate the progress of different projects with stakeholders."
