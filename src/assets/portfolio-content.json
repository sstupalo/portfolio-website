As a product manager I was in charge of numerous projects over the course of my 4-month coop term. Namely, I was responsible for the complete ownership two software products, ZenduTimeCard and Support Ticket add-in, I designed and managed the implementation of a self-serve model for our ZenduWork software, I developed user journeys for a new marketplace application, and I worked one-on-one with designers and developers to create and deploy multiple new websites and landing pages.\n\nZenduTimeCard is a time-tracking software that harnesses location tracking to automatically log employees’ hours and can be easily integrated with existing company payroll systems to make payroll more efficient and less error prone for HR administrators. Support Ticket add-in provides a comprehensive dashboard where administrators can submit and monitor the status of their company’s service requests. “Complete ownership” of each product meant that I was responsible for identifying and logging bugs, working with users to determine pain points, designing new features to tackle those pain points, writing structured development tickets, managing the priority of tickets, and finally, creating written and video documentation to describe how to use the tool and its new features.\n\nDesigning the ZenduWork self-serve model involved creating a thorough user journey that described the steps a user would take to create an account, learn the main features of the tool, and begin using the tool to manage their fleet’s work orders. Next, I worked with a designer to create cohesive and intuitive screens for each step of the process, transcribed welcome emails and steps for the onboarding tutorial, and monitored the initial development of this project.\n\nMy main learning outcomes from this position were how to create effective user journeys, how to manage myself and projects using modular ToDo lists, and how to communicate the progress of different projects with stakeholders."

My main term project involved developing the ability to simulate colour divergence and chromatic aberration within MDW. This full stack development used ReactJS to add UI inputs which allowed a user to select the translation, rotation, or scale of the red, green, or blue pixels of each projector. C++, CUDA, and OpenGL shaders were used to define the backend logic of each transformation and display where the transformed pixels would land on the screen.\n\nIn addition to my term project, I regularly completed bug fixes as they arose or were assigned to me."

This helped me to familiarize myself with the hardware I would continue to use throughout my term.\n\nLater I was responsible for updating all of the Gumstix meta layers and Yocto manifest to be compatible with Dunfell (the latest release of Yocto). While completing this task I learned how to configure PCB assemblies by modifying Device Tree Source files using overlays and parameters (pin multiplexing) to change the physical behaviour of targeted GPIOs.\n\nNear the end of my term I was tasked with enabling automatic detection and setup for two different Bluetooth/WiFi chip configurations. This involved writing Yocto recipes to install a module, initialisation tool, service, and udev rule file on the custom images. This was one of my most challenging work terms as I had to learn how to work with Linux, Yocto, and various hardware to be successful while working entirely remotely due to COVID-19. Despite the challenges, this term taught me resilience, resourcefulness, and when to ask for help."

          "content": "My decision to study at the University of Waterloo (UW) was a difficult one as it meant I would have to give up playing the sport of lacrosse. Instead of giving up the sport I loved, I founded a women’s lacrosse club at my school with the goal of one day developing into a competitive OUA varsity team. This project began in the fall of 2019 and has since developed into a co-ed club.\n\nDuring the summer prior to attending my first year I got started on this endeavor, collecting donated equipment, reaching out to UW athletics, advertising though the Ontario Lacrosse Association and navigating the club establishment process. In the fall I attended the Warriors Athletic Club fair to showcase our club and advertise our try-it sessions which proved to be a huge success.  By the end of our first term our club had 20 registered participants.  The restrictions due to the COVID pandemic made it more difficult for people to join our practices but participants’ continued engagement and interest have kept the club alive.\n\nNot every sports team I have participated on in the past has been as welcoming as it should have been so when creating my club’s constitution, I made sure to focus on developing policies to foster a positive and friendly environment.  I also decided to continue running a club team even after a varsity team has been established so that other students who join the club can enjoy the same benefits in a less competitive and demanding environment. Our club is also working with the UW Alliance, and the Black Liberated Athletes Coalition to ensure we are taking all steps necessary to truly embrace diversity and welcome everyone who may be interested in playing lacrosse. Since our club was built on the values of equity and inclusiveness, we work hard to balance our membership fees so that it is not a limiting factor for who can play in our club while also maximizing our revenue so that we can provide a stick for any player that does not already have one.\n\nNow I currently hold the position of President of the UW Field Lacrosse club team. In this role, I am responsible for chairing weekly executive meetings to plan future club initiatives as well as creating and executing 2 practice plans each week. One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced has been acquiring borrowed or cheap equipment since lacrosse is not a common sport. What I have learned is that good things come to those who seek them, and it was a matter of reaching out the right people to solve my problem. Not being afraid to ask for favors from the community has provided our club with over 60 sticks, 3 nets, and lots of lacrosse balls.\n\nThe success of the club so far has been extremely rewarding and I am excited at the prospect of reaching our club’s goal of becoming a competitive team prior to my graduation in 2024.",

          "content": "During my summer co-op term of 2022, I was fortunate to be living where I had access to a woodshop. Inspired by many of my boyfriend’s projects, I decided that I wanted to collaborate with him to create a waterfall coffee table. We had previously seen this type of table in a jewelry shop and thought this project would be a great use for our leftover live edge walnut board while expanding our woodworking skills.\n\nWe started by designing our table using pen and paper to make sure that using 18’’ hairpin legs would still leave enough material to have at least a 3’ table surface. Next, we measured 18’’ from one end of the plank and cut it on a 45-degree angle with a mitre saw to create the waterfall leg of the table. The type of cut was repeated twice on the remaining plank to create a mitre joint where the wood grain of the table surface seamlessly continued into the leg of the table. Once both planks were cut, we used walnut wood filler to fix any gouges and cracks in the wood. We then sanded each piece with 50, 100, 150, and 200 grit sandpaper to remove surface imperfections and make them smooth to the touch. Our next step involved gluing the two pieces together with wood glue. Although we had corner clamps, we decided not to use them since they would likely rip of the bark from the edges of the boards. Instead, we created a rig out of spare wood that allowed us to clamp the boards together at a 90-degree angle without damaging the bark. After the glue dried, we sanded each board again to remove any glue residue. We used tack cloths and pressurized air to remove all of the dust before applying multiple coats of polyurethane water-based wood finish to each surface and bark of the table. Once all the final coat of finish dried, we attached the hairpin legs and two L brackets to the underside of the table.\n\nSeeing the finished product of this table was extremely rewarding and I felt I learned a number of new skills throughout the process.",
